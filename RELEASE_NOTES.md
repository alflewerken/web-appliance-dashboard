# Release Notes - Version 1.1.5

**Release Date:** August 20, 2025  
**Type:** Minor Release - Major Frontend Refactoring

## üéâ Highlights

This release represents a massive improvement in code quality, maintainability, and user experience. We've reduced the codebase by over 7,600 lines while improving functionality and fixing critical bugs.

### Key Achievements
- **83% code reduction** in AuditLog components through modularization
- **~2,000 lines of dead code** eliminated
- **16 unused components** removed
- **Better organized** component structure with logical folders

## üöÄ What's New

### Complete AuditLog Modularization
The monolithic AuditLog component (2,800+ lines) has been split into 8 focused, maintainable modules:
- `AuditLogActions.js` - Action icons and formatting utilities
- `AuditLogFilters.js` - Advanced filtering interface
- `AuditLogRestore.js` - Restore functionality logic
- `AuditLogDetailRenderer.js` - Detail view rendering
- `AuditLogStats.js` - Statistics display cards
- `AuditLogExport.js` - Export functionality
- `AuditLogPanel.js` - Main orchestrator (reduced by 64%)
- `AuditLogTableMUI.js` - Table component (reduced by 83%)

### Frontend Component Organization
All components are now organized into logical folders with proper separation of concerns:
- `components/Appliances/` - 19 appliance-related components
- `components/SettingsPanel/` - 11 settings-related components
- `components/Hosts/` - Host management components
- Named exports via index.js for cleaner imports

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Critical Fixes
- **Panel Resize Bug** - Fixed issue where AuditLog panel could only be moved 2-3 pixels
