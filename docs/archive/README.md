# Documentation Archive

This directory contains archived documentation and debug scripts from the Web Appliance Dashboard project development.

## Structure

- `/archive/` - Historical implementation documentation
  - Various `.md` files documenting specific features and fixes
  - Implementation notes from development phases
  
- `/debug/` - Debug scripts and tools used during development
  - JavaScript debug utilities
  - Shell scripts for API testing
  - SSE and WebSocket testing tools
  
- `/debug-scripts/` - HTML test files and shell scripts
  - Terminal WebSocket tests
  - API test scripts
  - Direct component testing files
  
- `/test-scripts/` - Additional test utilities

## Purpose

These files are archived for historical reference and are no longer actively used in the project. They document the development process and can be useful for:

- Understanding implementation decisions
- Debugging similar issues in the future
- Reference for feature implementations
- Development history

## Note

These files are not required for the normal operation of the Web Appliance Dashboard and can be safely ignored for production deployments.
